# Faulty_Calculator_Program
Hi, this is my Faulty Calculator Program
This Python program is a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. Users are prompted to enter the first number, select an operator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), and input the second number. The program then executes the corresponding operation and provides the result.

The program also includes a few customized calculations for specific combinations of inputs. If the first number is 45, the operator is "*", and the second number is 3, the program outputs "555". Similarly, if the first number is 56, the operator is "+", and the second number is 9, the program outputs "77". Additionally, if the first number is 56, the operator is "/", and the second number is 6, the program outputs "4".

The code utilizes conditional statements to check for these specific combinations and provides the customized results when applicable. It also incorporates error handling to prevent potential issues, such as division by zero.

In summary, this concise Python program serves as a basic calculator with customized calculations, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations conveniently.
